######### Functionality which I have done in this project





I have made the shell page which is header, it will remain same in all the pages.

I have used the routing for one component to another component and for easy use I have used the child routing also.

If you will see at header you will get the three links which is 'search course' , 'learn how to study abroad'
and 'login/sign up', after clicking on it you will see the page where i have given the message.

I have used the bootstrap progress bar also to tell the profile completed.

Due to api I don't have I have used the static data, so that code is increased very much otherwise i will use the *ngFor and *ngIf directive for the repetation of the content which is used in the project.

I have made the responsive component for mobile view.

Page should be responsive.
2: Page should work in all major browsers yes
3: Side menu should be sticky. yes
4: Use any font-family. yes (oswald)
5: All data should be dynamic (Using Agularjs) yes
